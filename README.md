# Princey-Obsidian-Snippets
This is my repository for storing and sharing CSS snippets for Obsidian.
*As of June 25th, it's a bit out of date, sorry about that! I'm working on lots of big changes for the File Browser snippet in particular, so expect an update to that in the near future. Thanks for your patience!*

## Princey File Browser Colors:
This snippet adds folder and file icons next to your items in the file browser, and creates a color pattern effect.
Supports Make.md Spaces!

# Princey [Auto Card Link](https://github.com/nekoshita/obsidian-auto-card-link) Settings

I really liked this plugin, but by default it made white cards, which bothered me as a dark theme user. This snippet adds style settings support for changing almost everything about the link card! I've made the default settings in such a way that it should look handsome on a wide variety of themes by default, but it's easy to change it to suit your aesthetic preferences, now.


# To-do:
- [ ] Add comments and documentation to all snippets that don't already have them for the sake of clarity.
- [ ] Update snippets to most recent versions, making sure to remove features I may have accidentally added that aren't relevant to other users.
