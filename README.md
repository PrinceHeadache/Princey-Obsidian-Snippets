# Princey-Obsidian-Snippets
This is my repository for storing and sharing CSS snippets for Obsidian.


## Princey File Explorer Colors:
This snippet adds folder and file icons next to your items in the file explorer, and creates a color pattern effect.
Supports Make.md Spaces!

# Princey [Auto Card Link](https://github.com/nekoshita/obsidian-auto-card-link) Settings

I really liked this plugin, but by default it made white cards, which bothered me as a dark theme user. This snippet adds style settings support for changing almost everything about the link card! I've made the default settings in such a way that it should look handsome on a wide variety of themes by default, but it's easy to change it to suit your aesthetic preferences, now.


# To-do:
- [ ] Add comments and documentation to all snippets that don't already have them for the sake of clarity.
- [ ] Assign credit where I haven't already.
